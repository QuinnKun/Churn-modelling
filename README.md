# Churn-modelling-Using Neural Network
Churn modelling for bank customers using Artificial Neural Network

**Churn Modelling** 

It is very important in the customer retention analysis for any sector.
The output of a predictive churn model is a measure of the immediate or future risk of a customer cancellation(in this case whether the customer will stay in the bank or leave the bank)
*use cases*
- to understand why customers are leaving 
- to provide incentives to certain customers to prevent them from leaving
- predicting the revenue of the business

**Dataset** 

Kaggle dataset by the name Churn_Modelling.csv

**model used**

The model used here is a basic Artificial Neural Network(ANN) with 2 hidden layers run for 100 epochs.

**Framework and Libraries** 

-Pandas

-Numpy

-Keras running on Tensorflow backend

-Code compiled and run on Colab
